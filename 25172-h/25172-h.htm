		<h2 class="section_title">INTRODUCTION</h2>
		<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></p>

		<h3 class="subsection_title">Education as a public business</h3>
		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">It</span> is one of the complaints of the schoolmaster
		that the public does not defer to his professional
		opinion as completely as it does to that of practitioners
		in other professions. At first sight it
		might seem as though this indicated a defect
		either in the public or in the profession; and yet
		a wider view of the situation would suggest that
		such a conclusion is not a necessary one. The
		relations of education to the public are different
		from those of any other professional work. Education
		is a public business with us, in a sense that
		the protection and restoration of personal health
		or legal rights are not. To an extent characteristic
		of no other institution, save that of the state
		itself, the school has power to modify the social
		order. And under our political system, it is the
		right of each individual to have a voice in the
		making of social policies as, indeed, he has a vote
		in the determination of political affairs. If this
		<a class="pagenum" id="pagevi" title="vi">&nbsp;</a>be true, education is primarily a public business,
		and only secondarily a specialized vocation. The
		layman, then, will always have his right to some
		utterance on the operation of the public schools.</p>

		<h3 class="subsection_title">Education as expert service</h3>
		<p>I have said &#8220;some utterance,&#8221; but not &#8220;all&#8221;;
		for school-mastering has its own special mysteries,
		its own knowledge and skill into which the
		untrained layman cannot penetrate. We are just
		beginning to recognize that the school and the
		government have a common problem in this respect.
		Education and politics are two functions
		fundamentally controlled by public opinion. Yet
		the conspicuous lack of efficiency and economy
		in the school and in the state has quickened our
		recognition of a larger need for expert service.
		But just where shall public opinion justly express
		itself, and what shall properly be left to
		expert judgment?</p>

		<h3 class="subsection_title">The relations of expert opinion and public opinion</h3>
		<p>In so far as broad policies and ultimate ends
		affecting the welfare of all are to be determined,
		<a class="pagenum" id="pagevii" title="vii">&nbsp;</a>the public may well claim its right to settle issues
		by the vote or voice of majorities. But the selection
		and prosecution of the detailed ways and
		means by which the public will is to be executed
		efficiently must remain largely a matter of specialized
		and expert service. To the superior
		knowledge and technique required here, the public
		may well defer.</p>

		<p>In the conduct of the schools, it is well for the
		citizens to determine the ends proper to them,
		and it is their privilege to judge of the efficacy
		of results. Upon questions that concern all the
		manifold details by which children are to be converted
		into desirable types of men and women,
		the expert schoolmaster should be authoritative,
		at least to a degree commensurate with his superior
		knowledge of this very complex problem.
		The administration of the schools, the making
		of the course of study, the selection of texts,
		the prescription of methods of teaching, these
		are matters with which the people, or their representatives
		upon boards of education, cannot
		deal save with danger of becoming mere meddlers.</p>

		<h3 class="subsection_title"><a class="pagenum" id="pageviii" title="viii">&nbsp;</a>The discussion of moral education an illustration of mistaken views of laymen</h3>
		<p>Nowhere is the validity of this distinction between
		education as a public business and education
		as an expert professional service brought
		out more clearly than in an analysis of the public
		discussion of the moral work of the school. How
		frequently of late have those unacquainted with
		the special nature of the school proclaimed the
		moral ends of education and at the same time
		demanded direct ethical instruction as the particular
		method by which they were to be realized!
		This, too, in spite of the fact that those who
		know best the powers and limitations of instruction
		as an instrument have repeatedly pointed out
		the futility of assuming that knowledge of right
		constitutes a guarantee of right doing. How
		common it is for those who assert that education
		is for social efficiency to assume that the
		school should return to the barren discipline of
		the traditional formal subjects, reading, writing,
		and the rest! This, too, regardless of the fact
		that it has taken a century of educational evolution
		<a class="pagenum" id="pageix" title="ix">&nbsp;</a>to make the course of study varied and rich
		enough to call for those impulses and activities
		of social life which need training in the child.
		And how many who speak glowingly of the large
		services of the public schools to a democracy of
		free and self-reliant men affect a cynical and
		even vehement opposition to the &#8220;self-government
		of schools&#8221;! These would not have the
		children learn to govern themselves and one
		another, but would have the masters rule them,
		ignoring the fact that this common practice in
		childhood may be a foundation for that evil condition
		in adult society where the citizens are arbitrarily
		ruled by political bosses.</p>

		<p>One need not cite further cases of the incompetence
		of the lay public to deal with technical
		questions of school methods. Instances are plentiful
		to show that well-meaning people, competent
		enough to judge of the aims and results of
		school work, make a mistake in insisting upon
		the prerogative of directing the technical aspects
		of education with a dogmatism that would
		not characterize their statements regarding any
		other special field of knowledge or action.</p>

		<h3 class="subsection_title"><a class="pagenum" id="pagex" title="x">&nbsp;</a>A fundamental understanding of moral principles in education</h3>
		<p>Nothing can be more useful than for the public
		and the teaching profession to understand
		their respective functions. The teacher needs to
		understand public opinion and the social order,
		as much as the public needs to comprehend the
		nature of expert educational service. It will take
		time to draw the boundary lines that will be conducive
		to respect, restraint, and efficiency in
		those concerned; but a beginning can be made
		upon fundamental matters, and nothing so touches
		the foundations of our educational thought as a
		discussion of the moral principles in education.</p>

		<p>It is our pleasure to present a treatment of them
		by a thinker whose vital influence upon the reform
		of school methods is greater than that of
		any of his contemporaries. In his discussion of
		the social and psychological factors in moral education,
		there is much that will suggest what social
		opinion should determine, and much that will
		indicate what must be left to the trained teacher
		and school official.</p>

			THE MORAL PURPOSE OF THE SCHOOL</h2>
		<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></p>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">An</span> English contemporary philosopher has called
		attention to the difference between moral ideas
		and ideas about morality. &#8220;Moral ideas&#8221; are ideas
		of any sort whatsoever which take effect in conduct
		and improve it, make it better than it otherwise
		would be. Similarly, one may say, immoral
		ideas are ideas of whatever sort (whether arithmetical
		or geographical or physiological) which
		show themselves in making behavior worse than
		it would otherwise be; and non-moral ideas, one
		may say, are such ideas and pieces of information
		as leave conduct uninfluenced for either the
		better or the worse. Now &#8220;ideas about morality&#8221;
		may be morally indifferent or immoral or moral.
		There is nothing in the nature of ideas <em>about</em>
		morality, of information <em>about</em> honesty or purity
		or kindness which automatically transmutes such
		ideas into good character or good conduct.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page2" title="2">&nbsp;</a>This distinction between moral ideas, ideas
		of any sort whatsoever that have become a part
		of character and hence a part of the working motives
		of behavior, and ideas <em>about</em> moral action
		that may remain as inert and ineffective as if
		they were so much knowledge about Egyptian
		arch&aelig;ology, is fundamental to the discussion of
		moral education. The business of the educator&#8212;whether
		parent or teacher&#8212;is to see to it that
		the greatest possible number of ideas acquired
		by children and youth are acquired in such a
		vital way that they become <em>moving</em> ideas, motive-forces
		in the guidance of conduct. This
		demand and this opportunity make the moral
		purpose universal and dominant in all instruction&#8212;whatsoever
		the topic. Were it not for this
		possibility, the familiar statement that the ultimate
		purpose of all education is character-forming
		would be hypocritical pretense; for as
		every one knows, the direct and immediate attention
		of teachers and pupils must be, for the
		greater part of the time, upon intellectual matters.
		It is out of the question to keep direct moral considerations
		constantly uppermost. But it is not
		<a class="pagenum" id="page3" title="3">&nbsp;</a>out of the question to aim at making the methods
		of learning, of acquiring intellectual power, and
		of assimilating subject-matter, such that they will
		render behavior more enlightened, more consistent,
		more vigorous than it otherwise would be.</p>

		<p>The same distinction between &#8220;moral ideas&#8221;
		and &#8220;ideas about morality&#8221; explains for us a
		source of continual misunderstanding between
		teachers in the schools and critics of education
		outside of the schools. The latter look through the
		school programmes, the school courses of study,
		and do not find any place set apart for instruction
		in ethics or for &#8220;moral teaching.&#8221; Then
		they assert that the schools are doing nothing,
		or next to nothing, for character-training; they
		become emphatic, even vehement, about the
		moral deficiencies of public education. The schoolteachers,
		on the other hand, resent these criticisms
		as an injustice, and hold not only that they
		do &#8220;teach morals,&#8221; but that they teach them
		every moment of the day, five days in the week.
		In this contention the teachers <em>in principle</em> are
		in the right; if they are in the wrong, it is not
		because special periods are not set aside for what
		<a class="pagenum" id="page4" title="4">&nbsp;</a>after all can only be teaching <em>about</em> morals, but
		because their own characters, or their school atmosphere
		and ideals, or their methods of teaching,
		or the subject-matter which they teach, are
		not such <em>in detail</em> as to bring intellectual results
		into vital union with character so that they become
		working forces in behavior. Without discussing,
		therefore, the limits or the value of so-called
		direct moral instruction (or, better, instruction
		<em>about</em> morals), it may be laid down as fundamental
		that the influence of direct moral instruction,
		even at its very best, is <em>comparatively</em> small in
		amount and slight in influence, when the whole
		field of moral growth through education is taken
		into account. This larger field of indirect and vital
		moral education, the development of character
		through all the agencies, instrumentalities, and
		materials of school life is, therefore, the subject
		of our present discussion.</p>

		<h2 class="internal_title"><!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page5" title="5">&nbsp;</a> -->THE MORAL TRAINING GIVEN BY THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY</h2>

			THE MORAL TRAINING GIVEN BY THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY</h2>
		<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></p>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">There</span> cannot be two sets of ethical principles,
		one for life in the school, and the other for life
		outside of the school. As conduct is one, so also
		the principles of conduct are one. The tendency
		to discuss the morals of the school as if the school
		were an institution by itself is highly unfortunate.
		The moral responsibility of the school, and of
		those who conduct it, is to society. The school is
		fundamentally an institution erected by society to
		do a certain specific work,&#8212;to exercise a certain
		specific function in maintaining the life and advancing
		the welfare of society. The educational
		system which does not recognize that this fact entails
		upon it an ethical responsibility is derelict
		and a defaulter. It is not doing what it was called
		into existence to do, and what it pretends to do.
		Hence the entire structure of the school in general
		and its concrete workings in particular need
		<a class="pagenum" id="page8" title="8">&nbsp;</a>to be considered from time to time with reference
		to the social position and function of the
		school.</p>

		<p>The idea that the moral work and worth of the
		public school system as a whole are to be measured
		by its social value is, indeed, a familiar notion.
		However, it is frequently taken in too limited and
		rigid a way. The social work of the school is often
		limited to training for citizenship, and citizenship
		is then interpreted in a narrow sense as meaning
		capacity to vote intelligently, disposition to obey
		laws, etc. But it is futile to contract and cramp the
		ethical responsibility of the school in this way.
		The child is one, and he must either live his social
		life as an integral unified being, or suffer loss and
		create friction. To pick out one of the many social
		relations which the child bears, and to define the
		work of the school by that alone, is like instituting
		a vast and complicated system of physical exercise
		which would have for its object simply the development
		of the lungs and the power of breathing,
		independent of other organs and functions. The
		child is an organic whole, intellectually, socially,
		and morally, as well as physically. We must take
		<a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9">&nbsp;</a>the child as a member of society in the broadest
		sense, and demand for and from the schools whatever
		is necessary to enable the child intelligently
		to recognize all his social relations and take his
		part in sustaining them.</p>

		<p>To isolate the formal relationship of citizenship
		from the whole system of relations with which it
		is actually interwoven; to suppose that there is
		some one particular study or mode of treatment
		which can make the child a good citizen; to suppose,
		in other words, that a good citizen is anything
		more than a thoroughly efficient and serviceable
		member of society, one with all his powers of
		body and mind under control, is a hampering superstition
		which it is hoped may soon disappear
		from educational discussion.</p>

		<p>The child is to be not only a voter and a subject
		of law; he is also to be a member of a family, himself
		in turn responsible, in all probability, for
		rearing and training of future children, thereby
		maintaining the continuity of society. He is to be
		a worker, engaged in some occupation which will
		be of use to society, and which will maintain his
		own independence and self-respect. He is to be
		<a class="pagenum" id="page10" name="page10" title="10">&nbsp;</a>a member of some particular neighborhood and
		community, and must contribute to the values of
		life, add to the decencies and graces of civilization
		wherever he is. These are bare and formal
		statements, but if we let our imagination translate
		them into their concrete details, we have a wide and
		varied scene. For the child properly to take his
		place in reference to these various functions means
		training in science, in art, in history; means command
		of the fundamental methods of inquiry and
		the fundamental tools of intercourse and communication;
		means a trained and sound body,
		skillful eye and hand; means habits of industry,
		perseverance; in short, habits of serviceableness.</p>

		<p>Moreover, the society of which the child is to
		be a member is, in the United States, a democratic
		and progressive society. The child must
		be educated for leadership as well as for obedience.
		He must have power of self-direction and
		power of directing others, power of administration,
		ability to assume positions of responsibility.
		This necessity of educating for leadership is as
		great on the industrial as on the political side.</p>

		<p>New inventions, new machines, new methods of
		<a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11">&nbsp;</a>transportation and intercourse are making over
		the whole scene of action year by year. It is an
		absolute impossibility to educate the child for any
		fixed station in life. So far as education is conducted
		unconsciously or consciously on this basis,
		it results in fitting the future citizen for no station
		in life, but makes him a drone, a hanger-on,
		or an actual retarding influence in the onward
		movement. Instead of caring for himself and for
		others, he becomes one who has himself to be
		cared for. Here, too, the ethical responsibility of
		the school on the social side must be interpreted
		in the broadest and freest spirit; it is equivalent
		to that training of the child which will give him
		such possession of himself that he may take charge
		of himself; may not only adapt himself to the
		changes that are going on, but have power to
		shape and direct them.</p>

		<p>Apart from participation in social life, the
		school has no moral end nor aim. As long as we
		confine ourselves to the school as an isolated institution,
		we have no directing principles, because
		we have no object. For example, the end of education
		is said to be the harmonious development
		<a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12">&nbsp;</a>of all the powers of the individual. Here no reference
		to social life or membership is apparent, and
		yet many think we have in it an adequate and
		thoroughgoing definition of the goal of education.
		But if this definition be taken independently
		of social relationship we have no way of
		telling what is meant by any one of the terms
		employed. We do not know what a power is;
		we do not know what development is; we do not
		know what harmony is. A power is a power only
		with reference to the use to which it is put, the
		function it has to serve. If we leave out the uses
		supplied by social life we have nothing but the
		old &#8220;faculty psychology&#8221; to tell what is meant
		by power and what the specific powers are. The
		principle reduces itself to enumerating a lot of
		faculties like perception, memory, reasoning, etc.,
		and then stating that each one of these powers
		needs to be developed.</p>

		<p>Education then becomes a gymnastic exercise.
		Acute powers of observation and memory might
		be developed by studying Chinese characters;
		acuteness in reasoning might be got by discussing
		the scholastic subtleties of the Middle
		<a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13">&nbsp;</a>Ages. The simple fact is that there is no isolated
		faculty of observation, or memory, or reasoning
		any more than there is an original faculty of blacksmithing,
		carpentering, or steam engineering.
		Faculties mean simply that particular impulses
		and habits have been co&ouml;rdinated or framed with
		reference to accomplishing certain definite kinds
		of work. We need to know the social situations
		in which the individual will have to use ability to
		observe, recollect, imagine, and reason, in order
		to have any way of telling what a training of mental
		powers actually means.</p>

		<p>What holds in the illustration of this particular
		definition of education holds good from whatever
		point of view we approach the matter. Only
		as we interpret school activities with reference to
		the larger circle of social activities to which they
		relate do we find any standard for judging their
		moral significance.</p>

		<p>The school itself must be a vital social institution
		to a much greater extent than obtains at
		present. I am told that there is a swimming
		school in a certain city where youth are taught
		to swim without going into the water, being repeatedly
		<a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14">&nbsp;</a>drilled in the various movements which
		are necessary for swimming. When one of the
		young men so trained was asked what he did when
		he got into the water, he laconically replied,
		&#8220;Sunk.&#8221; The story happens to be true; were
		it not, it would seem to be a fable made expressly
		for the purpose of typifying the ethical relationship
		of school to society. The school cannot be
		a preparation for social life excepting as it reproduces,
		within itself, typical conditions of social
		life. At present it is largely engaged in the futile
		task of Sisyphus. It is endeavoring to form habits
		in children for use in a social life which, it would
		almost seem, is carefully and purposely kept
		away from vital contact with the child undergoing
		training. The only way to prepare for
		social life is to engage in social life. To form
		habits of social usefulness and serviceableness
		apart from any direct social need and motive,
		apart from any existing social situation, is, to the
		letter, teaching the child to swim by going through
		motions outside of the water. The most indispensable
		condition is left out of account, and the
		results are correspondingly partial.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15">&nbsp;</a>The much lamented separation in the schools
		of intellectual and moral training, of acquiring
		information and growing in character, is simply
		one expression of the failure to conceive and construct
		the school as a social institution, having
		social life and value within itself. Except so far
		as the school is an embryonic typical community
		life, moral training must be partly pathological
		and partly formal. Training is pathological when
		stress is laid upon correcting wrong-doing instead
		of upon forming habits of positive service. Too
		often the teacher&#8217;s concern with the moral life
		of pupils takes the form of alertness for failures
		to conform to school rules and routine. These
		regulations, judged from the standpoint of the
		development of the child at the time, are more
		or less conventional and arbitrary. They are rules
		which have to be made in order that the existing
		modes of school work may go on; but the lack of
		inherent necessity in these school modes reflects
		itself in a feeling, on the part of the child, that
		the moral discipline of the school is arbitrary.
		Any conditions that compel the teacher to take
		note of failures rather than of healthy growth
		<a class="pagenum" id="page16" title="16">&nbsp;</a>give false standards and result in distortion and
		perversion. Attending to wrong-doing ought to
		be an incident rather than a principle. The child
		ought to have a positive consciousness of what
		he is about, so as to judge his acts from the standpoint
		of reference to the work which he has
		to do. Only in this way does he have a vital
		standard, one that enables him to turn failures to
		account for the future.</p>

		<p>By saying that the moral training of the school
		is formal, I mean that the moral habits currently
		emphasized by the school are habits which are
		created, as it were, <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad hoc</em>. Even the habits of
		promptness, regularity, industry, non-interference
		with the work of others, faithfulness to
		tasks imposed, which are specially inculcated in
		the school, are habits that are necessary simply
		because the school system is what it is, and must
		be preserved intact. If we grant the inviolability
		of the school system as it is, these habits represent
		permanent and necessary moral ideas; but
		just in so far as the school system is itself
		isolated and mechanical, insistence upon these
		moral habits is more or less unreal, because the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page17" title="17">&nbsp;</a>ideal to which they relate is not itself necessary.
		The duties, in other words, are distinctly school
		duties, not life duties. If we compare this condition
		with that of the well-ordered home, we find
		that the duties and responsibilities that the child
		has there to recognize do not belong to the
		family as a specialized and isolated institution,
		but flow from the very nature of the social life in
		which the family participates and to which it contributes.
		The child ought to have the same motives
		for right doing and to be judged by the same
		standards in the school, as the adult in the wider
		social life to which he belongs. Interest in community
		welfare, an interest that is intellectual
		and practical, as well as emotional&#8212;an interest,
		that is to say, in perceiving whatever makes for
		social order and progress, and in carrying these
		principles into execution&#8212;is the moral habit to
		which all the special school habits must be related
		if they are to be animated by the breath of life.</p>

			THE MORAL TRAINING FROM METHODS OF INSTRUCTION</h2>
		<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></p>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">The</span> principle of the social character of the school
		as the basic factor in the moral education given
		may be also applied to the question of methods
		of instruction,&#8212;not in their details, but their
		general spirit. The emphasis then falls upon
		construction and giving out, rather than upon
		absorption and mere learning. We fail to recognize
		how essentially individualistic the latter
		methods are, and how unconsciously, yet certainly
		and effectively, they react into the child&#8217;s ways
		of judging and of acting. Imagine forty children
		all engaged in reading the same books, and in
		preparing and reciting the same lessons day after
		day. Suppose this process constitutes by far the
		larger part of their work, and that they are continually
		judged from the standpoint of what they
		are able to take in in a study hour and reproduce
		in a recitation hour. There is next to no
		<a class="pagenum" id="page22" title="22">&nbsp;</a>opportunity for any social division of labor.
		There is no opportunity for each child to work
		out something specifically his own, which he may
		contribute to the common stock, while he, in turn,
		participates in the productions of others. All are
		set to do exactly the same work and turn out the
		same products. The social spirit is not cultivated,&#8212;in
		fact, in so far as the purely individualistic
		method gets in its work, it atrophies for lack of
		use. One reason why reading aloud in school is
		poor is that the real motive for the use of language&#8212;the
		desire to communicate and to learn&#8212;is
		not utilized. The child knows perfectly well
		that the teacher and all his fellow pupils have
		exactly the same facts and ideas before them that
		he has; he is not <em>giving</em> them anything at all.
		And it may be questioned whether the moral
		lack is not as great as the intellectual. The child
		is born with a natural desire to give out, to do, to
		serve. When this tendency is not used, when
		conditions are such that other motives are substituted,
		the accumulation of an influence working
		against the social spirit is much larger than we
		have any idea of,&#8212;especially when the burden
		<a class="pagenum" id="page23" title="23">&nbsp;</a>of work, week after week, and year after year,
		falls upon this side.</p>

		<p>But lack of cultivation of the social spirit is
		not all. Positively individualistic motives and
		standards are inculcated. Some stimulus must
		be found to keep the child at his studies. At the
		best this will be his affection for his teacher, together
		with a feeling that he is not violating
		school rules, and thus negatively, if not positively,
		is contributing to the good of the school. I have
		nothing to say against these motives so far as
		they go, but they are inadequate. The relation
		between the piece of work to be done and affection
		for a third person is external, not intrinsic. It
		is therefore liable to break down whenever the
		external conditions are changed. Moreover, this
		attachment to a particular person, while in a way
		social, may become so isolated and exclusive as
		to be selfish in quality. In any case, the child
		should gradually grow out of this relatively external
		motive into an appreciation, for its own
		sake, of the social value of what he has to do,
		because of its larger relations to life, not pinned
		down to two or three persons.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page24" title="24">&nbsp;</a>But, unfortunately, the motive is not always
		at this relative best, but mixed with lower motives
		which are distinctly egoistic. Fear is a motive
		which is almost sure to enter in,&#8212;not necessarily
		physical fear, or fear of punishment, but
		fear of losing the approbation of others; or fear of
		failure, so extreme as to be morbid and paralyzing.
		On the other side, emulation and rivalry enter
		in. Just because all are doing the same work,
		and are judged (either in recitation or examination
		with reference to grading and to promotion)
		not from the standpoint of their personal contribution,
		but from that of <em>comparative</em> success,
		the feeling of superiority over others is unduly
		appealed to, while timid children are depressed.
		Children are judged with reference to their capacity
		to realize the same external standard. The
		weaker gradually lose their sense of power, and
		accept a position of continuous and persistent
		inferiority. The effect upon both self-respect and
		respect for work need not be dwelt upon. The
		strong learn to glory, not in their strength, but
		in the fact that they are stronger. The child
		is prematurely launched into the region of individualistic
		<a class="pagenum" id="page25" title="25">&nbsp;</a>competition, and this in a direction
		where competition is least applicable, namely, in
		intellectual and artistic matters, whose law is co&ouml;peration
		and participation.</p>

		<p>Next, perhaps, to the evils of passive absorption
		and of competition for external standing
		come, perhaps, those which result from the eternal
		emphasis upon preparation for a remote future.
		I do not refer here to the waste of energy
		and vitality that accrues when children, who live so
		largely in the immediate present, are appealed to
		in the name of a dim and uncertain future which
		means little or nothing to them. I have in mind
		rather the habitual procrastination that develops
		when the motive for work is future, not present;
		and the false standards of judgment that are created
		when work is estimated, not on the basis of
		present need and present responsibility, but by
		reference to an external result, like passing an
		examination, getting promoted, entering high
		school, getting into college, etc. Who can reckon
		up the loss of moral power that arises from the
		constant impression that nothing is worth doing
		in itself, but only as a preparation for something
		<a class="pagenum" id="page26" title="26">&nbsp;</a>else, which in turn is only a getting ready for some
		genuinely serious end beyond? Moreover, as a
		rule, it will be found that remote success is an
		end which appeals most to those in whom egoistic
		desire to get ahead&#8212;to get ahead of others&#8212;is
		already only too strong a motive. Those in
		whom personal ambition is already so strong that
		it paints glowing pictures of future victories may
		be touched; others of a more generous nature do
		not respond.</p>

		<p>I cannot stop to paint the other side. I can
		only say that the introduction of every method
		that appeals to the child&#8217;s active powers, to his
		capacities in construction, production, and creation,
		marks an opportunity to shift the centre of
		ethical gravity from an absorption which is selfish
		to a service which is social. Manual training is
		more than manual; it is more than intellectual;
		in the hands of any good teacher it lends itself
		easily, and almost as a matter of course, to development
		of social habits. Ever since the philosophy
		of Kant, it has been a commonplace of
		&aelig;sthetic theory, that art is universal; that it is
		not the product of purely personal desire or appetite,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page27" title="27">&nbsp;</a>or capable of merely individual appropriation,
		but has a value participated in by all who
		perceive it. Even in the schools where most conscious
		attention is paid to moral considerations,
		the methods of study and recitation may be
		such as to emphasize appreciation rather than
		power, an emotional readiness to assimilate the
		experiences of others, rather than enlightened
		and trained capacity to carry forward those values
		which in other conditions and past times made
		those experiences worth having. At all events,
		separation between instruction and character
		continues in our schools (in spite of the efforts of
		individual teachers) as a result of divorce between
		learning and doing. The attempt to attach genuine
		moral effectiveness to the mere processes of
		learning, and to the habits which go along with
		learning, can result only in a training infected with
		formality, arbitrariness, and an undue emphasis
		upon failure to conform. That there is as much
		accomplished as there is shows the possibilities
		involved in methods of school activity which
		afford opportunity for reciprocity, co&ouml;peration,
		and positive personal achievement.</p>

			THE SOCIAL NATURE OF THE COURSE OF STUDY</h2>
		<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></p>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">In</span> many respects, it is the subject-matter used
		in school life which decides both the general
		atmosphere of the school and the methods of instruction
		and discipline which rule. A barren
		&#8220;course of study,&#8221; that is to say, a meagre and
		narrow field of school activities, cannot possibly
		lend itself to the development of a vital social
		spirit or to methods that appeal to sympathy and
		co&ouml;peration instead of to absorption, exclusiveness,
		and competition. Hence it becomes an all
		important matter to know how we shall apply
		our social standard of moral value to the subject-matter
		of school work, to what we call, traditionally,
		the &#8220;studies&#8221; that occupy pupils.</p>

		<p><em>A study is to be considered as a means of bringing
		the child to realize the social scene of action.</em>
		Thus considered it gives a criterion for selection
		of material and for judgment of values. We have
		<a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32">&nbsp;</a>at present three independent values set up: one
		of culture, another of information, and another
		of discipline. In reality, these refer only to three
		phases of social interpretation. Information is
		genuine or educative only in so far as it presents
		definite images and conceptions of materials
		placed in a context of social life. Discipline is
		genuinely educative only as it represents a reaction
		of information into the individual&#8217;s own
		powers so that he brings them under control for
		social ends. Culture, if it is to be genuinely educative
		and not an external polish or factitious
		varnish, represents the vital union of information
		and discipline. It marks the socialization of the
		individual in his outlook upon life.</p>

		<p>This point may be illustrated by brief reference
		to a few of the school studies. In the first place,
		there is no line of demarkation within facts
		themselves which classifies them as belonging to
		science, history, or geography, respectively. The
		pigeon-hole classification which is so prevalent at
		present (fostered by introducing the pupil at the
		outset into a number of different studies contained
		in different text-books) gives an utterly erroneous
		<a class="pagenum" id="page33" title="33">&nbsp;</a>idea of the relations of studies to one another
		and to the intellectual whole to which all belong.
		In fact, these subjects have to do with the
		same ultimate reality, namely, the conscious experience
		of man. It is only because we have
		different interests, or different ends, that we sort
		out the material and label part of it science, part
		of it history, part geography, and so on. Each
		&#8220;sorting&#8221; represents materials arranged with
		reference to some one dominant typical aim or
		process of the social life.</p>

		<p>This social criterion is necessary, not only
		to mark off studies from one another, but also
		to grasp the reasons for each study,&#8212;the motives
		in connection with which it shall be presented.
		How, for example, should we define
		geography? What is the unity in the different
		so-called divisions of geography,&#8212;mathematical
		geography, physical geography, political geography,
		commercial geography? Are they purely
		empirical classifications dependent upon the brute
		fact that we run across a lot of different facts? Or
		is there some intrinsic principle through which
		the material is distributed under these various
		<a class="pagenum" id="page34" title="34">&nbsp;</a>heads,&#8212;something in the interest and attitude
		of the human mind towards them? I should say
		that geography has to do with all those aspects of
		social life which are concerned with the interaction
		of the life of man and nature; or, that it has
		to do with the world considered as the scene of
		social interaction. Any fact, then, will be geographical
		in so far as it has to do with the dependence
		of man upon his natural environment,
		or with changes introduced in this environment
		through the life of man.</p>

		<p>The four forms of geography referred to above
		represent, then, four increasing stages of abstraction
		in discussing the mutual relation of human
		life and nature. The beginning must be social
		geography, the frank recognition of the earth as
		the home of men acting in relations to one another.
		I mean by this that the essence of any geographical
		fact is the consciousness of two persons, or two
		groups of persons, who are at once separated and
		connected by their physical environment, and that
		the interest is in seeing how these people are at once
		kept apart and brought together in their actions by
		the instrumentality of the physical environment.
		<a class="pagenum" id="page35" title="35">&nbsp;</a>The ultimate significance of lake, river, mountain,
		and plain is not physical but social; it is the
		part which it plays in modifying and directing
		human relationships. This evidently involves an
		extension of the term commercial. It has to
		do not simply with business, in the narrow sense,
		but with whatever relates to human intercourse
		and intercommunication as affected by natural
		forms and properties. Political geography represents
		this same social interaction taken in a static
		instead of in a dynamic way; taken, that is, as
		temporarily crystallized and fixed in certain forms.
		Physical geography (including under this not
		simply physiography, but also the study of flora
		and fauna) represents a further analysis or abstraction.
		It studies the conditions which determine
		human action, leaving out of account, temporarily,
		the ways in which they concretely do
		this. Mathematical geography carries the analysis
		back to more ultimate and remote conditions,
		showing that the physical conditions of the earth
		are not ultimate, but depend upon the place which
		the world occupies in a larger system. Here, in
		other words, are traced, step by step, the links
		<a class="pagenum" id="page36" title="36">&nbsp;</a>which connect the immediate social occupations
		and groupings of men with the whole natural system
		which ultimately conditions them. Step by
		step the scene is enlarged and the image of what
		enters into the make-up of social action is widened
		and broadened; at no time is the chain of connection
		to be broken.</p>

		<p>It is out of the question to take up the studies
		one by one and show that their meaning is similarly
		controlled by social considerations. But I
		cannot forbear saying a word or two upon history.
		History is vital or dead to the child according as
		it is, or is not, presented from the sociological
		standpoint. When treated simply as a record of
		what has passed and gone, it must be mechanical,
		because the past, as the past, is remote. Simply
		as the past there is no motive for attending to
		it. The ethical value of history teaching will be
		measured by the extent to which past events are
		made the means of understanding the present,&#8212;affording
		insight into what makes up the structure
		and working of society to-day. Existing social
		structure is exceedingly complex. It is practically
		impossible for the child to attack it <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en
		<a class="pagenum" id="page37" title="37">&nbsp;</a>masse</em> and get any definite mental image of it.
		But type phases of historical development may be
		selected which will exhibit, as through a telescope,
		the essential constituents of the existing order.
		Greece, for example, represents what art and growing
		power of individual expression stand for;
		Rome exhibits the elements and forces of political
		life on a tremendous scale. Or, as these civilizations
		are themselves relatively complex, a study
		of still simpler forms of hunting, nomadic, and
		agricultural life in the beginnings of civilization,
		a study of the effects of the introduction of iron,
		and iron tools, reduces the complexity to simpler
		elements.</p>

		<p>One reason historical teaching is usually not
		more effective is that the student is set to acquire
		information in such a way that no epochs or factors
		stand out in his mind as typical; everything
		is reduced to the same dead level. The way to
		secure the necessary perspective is to treat the
		past as if it were a projected present with some
		of its elements enlarged.</p>

		<p>The principle of contrast is as important as
		that of similarity. Because the present life is so
		<a class="pagenum" id="page38" title="38">&nbsp;</a>close to us, touching us at every point, we cannot
		get away from it to see it as it really is. Nothing
		stands out clearly or sharply as characteristic. In
		the study of past periods, attention necessarily
		attaches itself to striking differences. Thus the
		child gets a locus of imagination, through which
		he can remove himself from the pressure of present
		surrounding circumstances and define them.</p>

		<p>History is equally available in teaching the
		<em>methods</em> of social progress. It is commonly stated
		that history must be studied from the standpoint
		of cause and effect. The truth of this statement
		depends upon its interpretation. Social life is so
		complex and the various parts of it are so organically
		related to one another and to the natural
		environment, that it is impossible to say that this
		or that thing is the cause of some other particular
		thing. But the study of history can reveal the
		main instruments in the discoveries, inventions,
		new modes of life, etc., which have initiated the
		great epochs of social advance; and it can present
		to the child types of the main lines of social progress,
		and can set before him what have been the
		chief difficulties and obstructions in the way of
		<a class="pagenum" id="page39" title="39">&nbsp;</a>progress. Once more this can be done only in so
		far as it is recognized that social forces in themselves
		are always the same,&#8212;that the same kind
		of influences were at work one hundred and one
		thousand years ago that are now working,&#8212;and
		that particular historical epochs afford illustration
		of the way in which the fundamental forces
		work.</p>

		<p>Everything depends, then, upon history being
		treated from a social standpoint; as manifesting
		the agencies which have influenced social development
		and as presenting the typical institutions
		in which social life has expressed itself. The
		culture-epoch theory, while working in the right
		direction, has failed to recognize the importance
		of treating past periods with relation to the present,&#8212;as
		affording insight into the representative
		factors of its structure; it has treated these
		periods too much as if they had some meaning
		or value in themselves. The way in which the
		biographical method is handled illustrates the
		same point. It is often treated in such a way as
		to exclude from the child&#8217;s consciousness (or at
		least not sufficiently to emphasize) the social
		<a class="pagenum" id="page40" title="40">&nbsp;</a>forces and principles involved in the association
		of the masses of men. It is quite true that the
		child is easily interested in history from the biographical
		standpoint; but unless &#8220;the hero&#8221; is
		treated in relation to the community life behind
		him that he sums up and directs, there is danger
		that history will reduce itself to a mere exciting
		story. Then moral instruction reduces itself to
		drawing certain lessons from the life of the particular
		personalities concerned, instead of widening
		and deepening the child&#8217;s imagination of social
		relations, ideals, and means.</p>

		<p>It will be remembered that I am not making
		these points for their own sake, but with reference
		to the general principle that when a study is
		taught as a mode of understanding social life it
		has positive ethical import. What the normal child
		continuously needs is not so much isolated moral
		lessons upon the importance of truthfulness and
		honesty, or the beneficent results that follow from
		a particular act of patriotism, as the formation
		of habits of social imagination and conception.</p>

		<p>I take one more illustration, namely, mathematics.
		This does, or does not, accomplish its
		<a class="pagenum" id="page41" title="41">&nbsp;</a>full purpose according as it is, or is not, presented
		as a social tool. The prevailing divorce between
		information and character, between knowledge
		and social action, stalks upon the scene here.
		The moment mathematical study is severed from
		the place which it occupies with reference to use
		in social life, it becomes unduly abstract, even
		upon the purely intellectual side. It is presented
		as a matter of technical relations and formul&aelig;
		apart from any end or use. What the study of
		number suffers from in elementary education is
		lack of motivation. Back of this and that and the
		other particular bad method is the radical mistake
		of treating number as if it were an end in itself,
		instead of the means of accomplishing some end.
		Let the child get a consciousness of what is the
		use of number, of what it really is for, and half the
		battle is won. Now this consciousness of the use
		of reason implies some end which is implicitly
		social.</p>

		<p>One of the absurd things in the more advanced
		study of arithmetic is the extent to which the
		child is introduced to numerical operations which
		have no distinctive mathematical principles characterizing
		<a class="pagenum" id="page42" title="42">&nbsp;</a>them, but which represent certain general
		principles found in business relationships.
		To train the child in these operations, while paying
		no attention to the business realities in which
		they are of use, or to the conditions of social
		life which make these business activities necessary,
		is neither arithmetic nor common sense.
		The child is called upon to do examples in interest,
		partnership, banking, brokerage, and so on
		through a long string, and no pains are taken to
		see that, in connection with the arithmetic, he
		has any sense of the social realities involved.
		This part of arithmetic is essentially sociological
		in its nature. It ought either to be omitted entirely,
		or else be taught in connection with a study
		of the relevant social realities. As we now manage
		the study, it is the old case of learning to swim
		apart from the water over again, with correspondingly
		bad results on the practical side.</p>

		<p>In concluding this portion of the discussion,
		we may say that our conceptions of moral education
		have been too narrow, too formal, and too
		pathological. We have associated the term ethical
		with certain special acts which are labeled virtues
		<a class="pagenum" id="page43" title="43">&nbsp;</a>and are set off from the mass of other acts, and are
		still more divorced from the habitual images and
		motives of the children performing them. Moral
		instruction is thus associated with teaching about
		these particular virtues, or with instilling certain
		sentiments in regard to them. The moral has been
		conceived in too goody-goody a way. Ultimate
		moral motives and forces are nothing more or
		less than social intelligence&#8212;the power of observing
		and comprehending social situations,&#8212;and
		social power&#8212;trained capacities of control&#8212;at
		work in the service of social interest and
		aims. There is no fact which throws light upon
		the constitution of society, there is no power
		whose training adds to social resourcefulness
		that is not moral.</p>

		<p>I sum up, then, this part of the discussion by
		asking your attention to the moral trinity of the
		school. The demand is for social intelligence,
		social power, and social interests. Our resources
		are (1) the life of the school as a social institution
		in itself; (2) methods of learning and of doing
		work; and (3) the school studies or curriculum.
		In so far as the school represents, in its own
		<a class="pagenum" id="page44" title="44">&nbsp;</a>spirit, a genuine community life; in so far as
		what are called school discipline, government,
		order, etc., are the expressions of this inherent
		social spirit; in so far as the methods used are
		those that appeal to the active and constructive
		powers, permitting the child to give out and thus
		to serve; in so far as the curriculum is so selected
		and organized as to provide the material
		for affording the child a consciousness of the
		world in which he has to play a part, and the demands
		he has to meet; so far as these ends
		are met, the school is organized on an ethical
		basis. So far as general principles are concerned,
		all the basic ethical requirements are met. The
		rest remains between the individual teacher and
		the individual child.</p>

			THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECT OF MORAL EDUCATION</h2>
		<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#contents">Contents</a></p>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">So</span> far we have been considering the make-up of
		purposes and results that constitute conduct&#8212;its
		&#8220;what.&#8221; But conduct has a certain method
		and spirit also&#8212;its &#8220;how.&#8221; Conduct may be
		looked upon as expressing the attitudes and dispositions

		results and maintaining the social fabric. A consideration
		of conduct as a mode of individual performance,
		personal doing, takes us from the social
		to the psychological side of morals. In the first
		place, all conduct springs ultimately and radically
		out of native instincts and impulses. We must
		know what these instincts and impulses are, and
		what they are at each particular stage of the
		child&#8217;s development, in order to know what to appeal
		to and what to build upon. Neglect of this
		principle may give a mechanical imitation of
		moral conduct, but the imitation will be ethically
		<a class="pagenum" id="page48" title="48">&nbsp;</a>dead, because it is external and has its centre
		without, not within, the individual. We must
		study the child, in other words, to get our indications,
		our symptoms, our suggestions. The more
		or less spontaneous acts of the child are not to
		be thought of as setting moral forms to which the
		efforts of the educator must conform&#8212;this would
		result simply in spoiling the child; but they are
		symptoms which require to be interpreted: stimuli
		which need to be responded to in directed ways;
		material which, in however transformed a shape,
		is the only ultimate constituent of future moral
		conduct and character.</p>

		<p>Then, secondly, our ethical principles need to
		be stated in psychological terms because the
		child supplies us with the only means or instruments
		by which to realize moral ideals. The subject-matter
		of the curriculum, however important,
		however judiciously selected, is empty of conclusive
		moral content until it is made over into terms
		of the individual&#8217;s own activities, habits, and desires.
		We must know what history, geography, and
		mathematics mean in psychological terms, that
		is, as modes of personal experiencing, before
		<a class="pagenum" id="page49" title="49">&nbsp;</a>we can get out of them their moral potentialities.</p>

		<p>The psychological side of education sums itself
		up, of course, in a consideration of character.
		It is a commonplace to say that the development
		of character is the end of all school work.
		The difficulty lies in the execution of the idea.
		And an underlying difficulty in this execution is
		the lack of a clear conception of what character
		means. This may seem an extreme statement.
		If so, the idea may be conveyed by saying that
		we generally conceive of character simply in
		terms of results; we have no clear conception of
		it in psychological terms&#8212;that is, as a process,
		as working or dynamic. We know what character
		means in terms of the actions which proceed from
		it, but we have not a definite conception of it on
		its inner side, as a system of working forces.</p>

		<p>(1) Force, efficiency in execution, or overt action,
		is one necessary constituent of character.
		In our moral books and lectures we may lay the
		stress upon good intentions, etc. But we know
		practically that the kind of character we hope to
		build up through our education is one that not
		<a class="pagenum" id="page50" title="50">&nbsp;</a>only has good intentions, but that insists upon
		carrying them out. Any other character is wishy-washy;
		it is goody, not good. The individual
		must have the power to stand up and count for
		something in the actual conflicts of life. He must
		have initiative, insistence, persistence, courage,
		and industry. He must, in a word, have all that
		goes under the name &#8220;<em>force</em> of character.&#8221; Undoubtedly,
		individuals differ greatly in their native
		endowment in this respect. None the less, each
		has a certain primary equipment of impulse, of
		tendency forward, of innate urgency to do. The
		problem of education on this side is that of discovering
		what this native fund of power is, and
		then of utilizing it in such a way (affording conditions
		which both stimulate and control) as to
		organize it into definite conserved modes of action&#8212;habits.</p>

		<p>(2) But something more is required than sheer
		force. Sheer force may be brutal; it may override
		the interests of others. Even when aiming
		at right ends it may go at them in such a way as
		to violate the rights of others. More than this,
		in sheer force there is no guarantee for the right
		<a class="pagenum" id="page51" title="51">&nbsp;</a>end. Efficiency may be directed towards mistaken
		ends and result in positive mischief and destruction.
		Power, as already suggested, must be directed.
		It must be organized along social channels;
		it must be attached to valuable ends.</p>

		<p>This involves training on both the intellectual
		and emotional side. On the intellectual side we
		must have judgment&#8212;what is ordinarily called
		good sense. The difference between mere knowledge,
		or information, and judgment is that the
		former is simply held, not used; judgment is
		knowledge directed with reference to the accomplishment
		of ends. Good judgment is a sense of
		respective or proportionate values. The one who
		has judgment is the one who has ability to size
		up a situation. He is the one who can grasp the
		scene or situation before him, ignoring what is
		irrelevant, or what for the time being is unimportant,
		who can seize upon the factors which demand
		attention, and grade them according to their respective
		claims. Mere knowledge of what the
		right is, in the abstract, mere intentions of following
		the right in general, however praiseworthy
		in themselves, are never a substitute for this
		<a class="pagenum" id="page52" title="52">&nbsp;</a>power of trained judgment. Action is always in
		the concrete. It is definite and individualized.
		Except, therefore, as it is backed and controlled
		by a knowledge of the actual concrete factors in
		the situation in which it occurs, it must be relatively
		futile and waste.</p>

		<p>(3) But the consciousness of ends must be more
		than merely intellectual. We can imagine a person
		with most excellent judgment, who yet does not
		act upon his judgment. There must not only be
		force to ensure effort in execution against obstacles,
		but there must also be a delicate personal
		responsiveness,&#8212;there must be an emotional reaction.
		Indeed, good judgment is impossible without
		this susceptibility. Unless there is a prompt
		and almost instinctive sensitiveness to conditions,
		to the ends and interests of others, the intellectual
		side of judgment will not have proper
		material to work upon. Just as the material of
		knowledge is supplied through the senses, so
		the material of ethical knowledge is supplied by
		emotional responsiveness. It is difficult to put
		this quality into words, but we all know the difference
		between the character which is hard and
		<a class="pagenum" id="page53" title="53">&nbsp;</a>formal, and one which is sympathetic, flexible,
		and open. In the abstract the former may be as
		sincerely devoted to moral ideas as is the latter,
		but as a practical matter we prefer to live with
		the latter. We count upon it to accomplish
		more by tact, by instinctive recognition of the
		claims of others, by skill in adjusting, than the
		former can accomplish by mere attachment to
		rules.</p>

		<p>Here, then, is the moral standard, by which
		to test the work of the school upon the side of
		what it does directly for individuals. (<em>a</em>) Does
		the school as a system, at present, attach sufficient
		importance to the spontaneous instincts
		and impulses? Does it afford sufficient opportunity
		for these to assert themselves and work out
		their own results? Can we even say that the
		school in principle attaches itself, at present, to
		the active constructive powers rather than to processes
		of absorption and learning? Does not our
		talk about self-activity largely render itself meaningless
		because the self-activity we have in mind
		is purely &#8220;intellectual,&#8221; out of relation to those
		impulses which work through hand and eye?</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page54" title="54">&nbsp;</a>Just in so far as the present school methods
		fail to meet the test of such questions moral results
		must be unsatisfactory. We cannot secure
		the development of positive force of character
		unless we are willing to pay its price. We cannot
		smother and repress the child&#8217;s powers, or gradually
		abort them (from failure of opportunity for
		exercise), and then expect a character with initiative
		and consecutive industry. I am aware of the
		importance attaching to inhibition, but mere inhibition
		is valueless. The only restraint, the only
		holding-in, that is of any worth is that which
		comes through holding powers concentrated
		upon a positive end. An end cannot be attained
		excepting as instincts and impulses are kept from
		discharging at random and from running off on
		side tracks. In keeping powers at work upon their
		relevant ends, there is sufficient opportunity for
		genuine inhibition. To say that inhibition is
		higher than power, is like saying that death is
		more than life, negation more than affirmation,
		sacrifice more than service.</p>

		<p>(<em>b</em>) We must also test our school work by finding
		whether it affords the conditions necessary
		<a class="pagenum" id="page55" title="55">&nbsp;</a>for the formation of good judgment. Judgment
		as the sense of relative values involves ability to
		select, to discriminate. Acquiring information
		can never develop the power of judgment. Development
		of judgment is in spite of, not because
		of, methods of instruction that emphasize simple
		learning. The test comes only when the information
		acquired has to be put to use. Will it
		do what we expect of it? I have heard an educator
		of large experience say that in her judgment the
		greatest defect of instruction to-day, on the intellectual
		side, is found in the fact that children
		leave school without a mental perspective. Facts
		seem to them all of the same importance. There
		is no foreground or background. There is no instinctive
		habit of sorting out facts upon a scale
		of worth and of grading them.</p>

		<p>The child cannot get power of judgment excepting
		as he is continually exercised in forming
		and testing judgments. He must have an opportunity
		to select for himself, and to attempt to put
		his selections into execution, that he may submit
		them to the final test, that of action. Only thus
		can he learn to discriminate that which promises
		<a class="pagenum" id="page56" title="56">&nbsp;</a>success from that which promises failure; only
		thus can he form the habit of relating his purposes
		and notions to the conditions that determine
		their value. Does the school, as a system,
		afford at present sufficient opportunity for this
		sort of experimentation? Except so far as the
		emphasis of the school work is upon intelligent
		doing, upon active investigation, it does not furnish
		the conditions necessary for that exercise
		of judgment which is an integral factor in good
		character.</p>

		<p>(<em>c</em>) I shall be brief with respect to the other
		point, the need of susceptibility and responsiveness.
		The informally social side of education, the
		&aelig;sthetic environment and influences, are all-important.
		In so far as the work is laid out in
		regular and formulated ways, so far as there are
		lacking opportunities for casual and free social
		intercourse between pupils and between the pupils
		and the teacher, this side of the child&#8217;s nature
		is either starved, or else left to find haphazard
		expression along more or less secret channels.
		When the school system, under plea of the practical
		(meaning by the practical the narrowly utilitarian),
		<a class="pagenum" id="page57" title="57">&nbsp;</a>confines the child to the three R&#8217;s and
		the formal studies connected with them, shuts
		him out from the vital in literature and history,
		and deprives him of his right to contact with
		what is best in architecture, music, sculpture, and
		picture, it is hopeless to expect definite results
		in the training of sympathetic openness and responsiveness.</p>

		<p class="post_thoughtbreak">What we need in education is a genuine faith
		in the existence of moral principles which are
		capable of effective application. We believe, so
		far as the mass of children are concerned, that if
		we keep at them long enough we can teach reading
		and writing and figuring. We are practically,
		even if unconsciously, skeptical as to the possibility
		of anything like the same assurance in
		morals. We believe in moral laws and rules, to
		be sure, but they are in the air. They are something
		set off by themselves. They are so <i>very</i>
		&#8220;moral&#8221; that they have no working contact with
		the average affairs of every-day life. These moral
		principles need to be brought down to the ground
		through their statement in social and in psychological
		<a class="pagenum" id="page58" title="58">&nbsp;</a>terms. We need to see that moral
		principles are not arbitrary, that they are not
		&#8220;transcendental&#8221;; that the term &#8220;moral&#8221; does
		not designate a special region or portion of life.
		We need to translate the moral into the conditions
		and forces of our community life, and into
		the impulses and habits of the individual.</p>

		<p>All the rest is mint, anise, and cummin. The
		one thing needful is that we recognize that
		moral principles are real in the same sense in
		which other forces are real; that they are inherent
		in community life, and in the working structure
		of the individual. If we can secure a genuine faith
		in this fact, we shall have secured the condition
		which alone is necessary to get from our educational
		system all the effectiveness there is in
		it. The teacher who operates in this faith will
		find every subject, every method of instruction,
		every incident of school life pregnant with moral
		possibility.</p>
